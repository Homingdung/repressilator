# Abstract
The repressilator is a genetic network where three genes code for proteins whose presence
results in a repression of the next gene in a circular way, which forms a negative feedback
loop with nonlinear interactions. Elowitz and Leibler (2000) describe this network in terms
of six nonlinear first-order differential equations. Such a system can exhibit oscillations,
which is valuable to study because this model can be implemented experimentally through
artificial regulatory networks. In this project, we aim to investigate the mathematical con-
ditions to exhibit oscillatory behaviours of repressilators. We use both mathematical and
computational approaches to study the stability of the differential system. We find that
significant effects of cooperative binding, efficient repressions and high transcription rate
promote oscillations. We confirm the existence of Hopf bifurcation by demonstrating the
bifurcation diagram and the formation of the limit cycle numerically. We also show the
numerical simulations of dynamical behaviours of repressilator on different parameters.
Finally, we find more complex behaviours of the genetic network by extending the re-
pressilator in two ways: 1) adding spatial effects, leading to synchronization property. 2)
adding more genes in the loop, leading to the change of frequency and amplitude of the
oscillation associated with different parameters.
